# **SELL IT! Used Textbook Marketplace - A MERN Stack Application with AI-Enabled Workflows**

A full-stack MERN application with AI-enabled workflows that facilitates the buying and selling of used textbooks among university students.

This project is inspired by a real problem encountered as a student: textbooks are expensive, reselling them is time-consuming, and existing solutions are often fragmented, unreliable, or poorly structured. The application is designed specifically for a university context, with a focus on trust, usability, and informed decision-making.

## **Key Features**

### User Authentication & Roles
Supports student and admin accounts with role-based access to ensure appropriate permissions and content moderation.

### Textbook Listings (CRUD)
Allows users to create, view, update, and delete structured textbook listings with metadata such as course code, condition, and price.

### Admin Moderation Workflow
Enables administrators to review, manage, and maintain the quality and consistency of textbook listings before and after publication.

### Browsing & Filtering
Provides efficient browsing and filtering of textbooks based on academic relevance and listing attributes.

## **AI-Enabled Workflows**

### AI-Generated Textbook Summaries
Automatically generates concise, student-friendly summaries when an admin adds a textbook and stores them for reuse across the application.

### AI-Assisted Academic Categorization
Classifies textbooks by selecting relevant majors from a predefined list of UCT majors to ensure consistent, controlled categorization.

## **Tech Stack**
